            Darling just dive right in and follow my lead
            Well I found a girl beautiful and sweet
            I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
            Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
            Not knowing what it was I will not give you up this time
            But darling just kiss me slow your heart is all I own
            And in your eyes you're holding mine
            Baby I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
            Barefoot on the grass listening to our favourite song</p></div>
            <div class="d2"><p>When you said you looked a mess I whispered underneath my breath
                But you heard it darling you look perfect tonight
                Well I found a woman stronger than anyone I know
                She shares my dreams I hope that someday I'll share her home
                I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
                To carry love to carry children of our own
                We are still kids but we're so in love fighting against all odds
                I know we'll be alright this time</p></div>
